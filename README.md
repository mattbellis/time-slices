# time-slices
Code to take part of a movie, identify the moving parts, and simulate a multiple exposure image. Useful for teaching kinematics and having students calculate the motion of things from a static image.

# Getting started

Install [opencv and the python module](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) on your system.

This can be...challenging. 

## Test your system

Read in and display two images using the opencv python library. 

'''
python test_your_opencv_installation.py
'''

"Add" two images.

'''
python add_two_images.py
'''

## Mock-up a multiple-exposure image!
